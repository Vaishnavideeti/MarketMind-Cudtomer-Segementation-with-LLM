#  MarketMind: Customer Segmentation using LLM

**MarketMind** is a customer segmentation pipeline powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and clustering algorithms. It transforms customer data—especially textual attributes—into meaningful segments using semantic understanding, outlier filtering, and unsupervised learning. This empowers marketers and analysts to discover hidden customer groups and derive actionable insights.

##  Why Use LLMs for Customer Segmentation?

Traditional clustering methods struggle to deal with unstructured data such as customer reviews, preferences, and behavioral notes. LLMs help overcome this by:

-  **Semantic Embedding**: Transforming raw text into dense, meaningful vector representations.
-  **Context-Aware Grouping**: Capturing hidden intent and behavior patterns from textual data.
-  **Segment Explainability**: Helping generate natural-language summaries for each cluster.
