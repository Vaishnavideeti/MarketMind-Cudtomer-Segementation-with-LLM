# MarketMind-Customer-Segementation-with-LLM
 
MarketMind is a customer segmentation system that utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to intelligently group customers based on their behavioral, demographic, or textual data. It goes beyond traditional clustering by capturing deep semantic patterns from customer attributes, enabling more accurate, insightful, and actionable segments.

##  Why Use LLMs for Customer Segmentation?

Traditional clustering algorithms (like KMeans or DBSCAN) work well for structured numerical data, but struggle with unstructured or textual data (e.g., customer feedback, preferences, purchase descriptions). 

LLMs offer several advantages:

-  **Semantic Understanding**: LLMs convert unstructured customer data into meaningful embeddings.
-  **Contextual Grouping**: Similar customers (even with different wording) are grouped based on meaning, not just keywords.
-  **Explainability**: LLMs can generate natural language summaries of each customer segment, improving interpretability for business teams.
